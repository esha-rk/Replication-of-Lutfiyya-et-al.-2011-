# Replication Study: Adequacy of Diabetes Care for Older U.S. Rural Adults

This project replicates the study *"Adequacy of diabetes care for older U.S. rural adults: a cross-sectional population-based study using 2009 BRFSS data"* by Lutfiyya et al. (2011). Using the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset, I reproduced the original analysis using STATA and assessed the validity of the published findings.

Additionally, I extended the study by conducting a parallel analysis using the 2019 BRFSS dataset to evaluate how diabetes care patterns have evolved over a 10-year period.

### Objectives
- Replicate the original 2009 analysis to verify the reproducibility of published results.
- Compare diabetes care indicators between 2009 and 2019 among older rural adults.
- Identify trends or shifts in healthcare adequacy over time.

### Tools Used
- STATA 18
- BRFSS datasets (2009, 2019)

### Key Findings

- My replication showed that the results from the original 2009 Lutfiyya et al. paper were largely reproducible using the same BRFSS dataset and methods.
- However, when I repeated the analysis using 2019 BRFSS data to examine changes after 10 years, we found that rural U.S. adults continued to experience disparities in diabetes careâ€”and, in some cases, these disparities had worsened.
- Specifically, the odds of rural adults receiving less than adequate diabetes care were higher in 2019 compared to 2009.
- Older adults in rural areas had higher odds of deferring medical care due to cost and of not having a healthcare provider. Notably, the odds of not having a healthcare provider were significantly higher in 2019 than in 2009.
